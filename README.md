# SQL-RockbusterVideoRental

**Introduction**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team i s planning to use i ts existing movie l icenses to
launch an online video rental service i n order to stay competitive.
You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business i ntelligence (BI)
department to help with the l aunch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from i nventory to customer i nsights, with data-related
queries. Your first task i s to l oad all of Rockbuster’s data i nto a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis i nto an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
