/*
This SQL query retrieves information about the top 5 customers based on the total amount they have paid from cities specified in the WHERE clause. It then calculates the count of all customers and the count of top customers (those from the top 5 list) for each country. The query provides insights into customer distribution across countries and highlights the presence of top-spending customers in those countries.
